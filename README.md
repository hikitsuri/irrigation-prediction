# Irrigation Prediction App

## Description
This project is an irrigation prediction app that uses a machine learning model to predict soil moisture levels based on input features. The application is deployed on Heroku.

## Features
- Predict soil moisture levels using a trained machine learning model
- Easy-to-use API for making predictions
- Detailed logs and error handling

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9
- pip

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/irrigation-prediction.git
cd irrigation-prediction
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Run the Application Locally
```bash
python app.py
```

### Predict Soil Moisture
To predict soil moisture, send a POST request to the `/predict` endpoint with input features. Below are examples using `curl` and Postman.

#### Using `curl`
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"features\": [1, 2, 3, 4]}" https://irrigation-prediction-d56529386fb6.herokuapp.com/predict
```

#### Using Postman
1. Open Postman.
2. Set the request type to POST.
3. Enter the URL: `https://irrigation-prediction-d56529386fb6.herokuapp.com/predict`
4. Go to the Body tab, select `raw` and `JSON` format.
5. Enter the JSON data:
   ```json
   {
     "features": [1, 2, 3, 4]
   }
   ```
6. Send the request.

### Example Response
```json
[32.15756033272455]
```

## Deployment

### Deploy on Heroku

#### Create a new Heroku app
```bash
heroku create
```

#### Push your code to Heroku
```bash
git push heroku main
```

### Example Deployment URL
